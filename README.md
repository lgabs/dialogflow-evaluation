# dialogflow-evaluation
Project to evaluate metrics of your dialogflow chatbot. The ideia here is to define dialogs in yaml-style so you can test your deployed chatbot for the main dialogs it should respond. The inspiration is the Rasa Open Source [solution](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/examples/moodbot/data/stories.yml) for these dialogs that are used to train the chatbot.
